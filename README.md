E-COMMERCE SALES DASHBOARD
An E-Commerce Sales Dashboard is a visual tool that displays key business metrics such as total sales, revenue, profit, orders, customer trends, and top-selling products in one place. It helps managers and analysts quickly monitor performance, identify sales patterns, track growth, and make data-driven decisions. Interactive charts and filters allow users to analyze data by time, region, category, and customer behavior for better business insights.
